This letter is not about money.During the weekend I was sitting with my partner on our balcony. Reflecting on my career journey and how far I've come.Thinking about how very hard it was at the beginning.I realised my career was in 2 phases:**The hardcore programmer phase**. Where I coded every single day like my life depended on it. All I could do was code. I didn't want to hear anything. Have an idea ? Boom. We start coding tonight. By next week I have a demo.I was at this phase for the first 4 years of my career.I was also earning peanuts even though I was top of the game in talent and skills. I was working 16hours a day, and I thought this image was funny:![facebook profile picture january 2018](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/2829/conversions/26166188_693297724201365_1644936597610981103_n-(1)-image.jpg)This was actually my Facebook Profile Picture in January 2018.You should love me right now because I had to login to facebook this morning just to pull this image.Anyways. Whatever you do don't login to Facebook. I digress.**The Software Engineer phase**. When I realised coding is just 50% of what I need to succeed.I realised I can work for a very flexible company, where culture is top notch, and work is very impactful.I realised the reason I was flopping all those interviews and never getting a callback. Even though I was a hardcore coder.In many ways, my eyes opened to the career mistakes I was making.That year, I landed my first 5-figure remote job that pays in USD.It was a complete mindset shift. How I talked, what I focused on, who I was completely changed.4 things changed in my mindset.But today, I'll give you just one. If there's one thing you learn and stick with from these newsletters, it should be this.> It's not about you and your skills. It's about the business and their success.![tweet about business value](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/2830/conversions/oie_qFfAzzSk9u0K-image.png)My mindset shifted completely from being code focused to being business focused.This completely changed my language. No longer was I talking about my programming languages and tech skills. I talked more about business and value.Let me give you a practical example.Before my mindset shift, during interviews, they'll ask me:What is your greatest strength ?And I'll say:> I use design patterns, object oriented practices and write automated tests.After my mindset shift, my answer changed:> I can analyse the needs of a business, and contribute the specific value the business needs using my engineering skills.Both mindsets look good, but one sells way more than the other.Companies are looking for the best engineers. But they absolutely treasure an engineer that is business and value oriented.Not only do you need to be very good at your coding skills, but you need to take it a step higher.Ask yourself everyday: ***what high value can I contribute to a company*** ?Whatever value you contribute must convert to money for the business.This completely changed everything. My communication, my interviews, my portfolio projects, my open source work, everything.No more building YouTube clones. Those are great for practice projects and will definitely boost your portfolio. But there's a next level.Building real products that solve business problems. This is the year I built Nesabox: an automation tool to deploy NodeJS applications to the cloud.A real product solving a real business problem.I have so many examples, but I'll stop here.As a takeaway from this letter, ask yourself these questions:> Am I a developer or designer that thinks business value, or think coding and figma all the time ?> Do I care about the business success and how I can contribute ?> Can I derive solutions to business problems without thinking code first ?This mind shift has helped my mentees skip my first 4 wasted years and land 6-figure jobs in the first 4 years, instead of 8 years like I did.Until next week, stay value focused.             [Online version](https://frantz.mailcoach.app/webview/campaign/9a1ce34a-22c8-42b9-8626-5c18c59a7acb) â€¢ [Unsubscribe](https://frantz.mailcoach.app/unsubscribe/fbba01de-5bd1-468f-a377-3337dae3438e/704a0743-3898-45c8-8b45-e621db20d5ae)     Sent by [Frantz Kati](https://twitter.com/bahdcoder?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=from-n83km-to-n4530000m-story-of-my-unusual-tech-journey)
