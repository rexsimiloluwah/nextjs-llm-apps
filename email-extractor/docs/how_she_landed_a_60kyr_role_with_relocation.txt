I noticed it wasn't charged.Picked up my charger and was wondering why it was so short.Only to find out that Elsa ate my charger. See the stubborn child here.![picture of me and Elsa](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/3024/conversions/0c2e88d8-ba8f-4c24-99e5-699fc4965ef2jpeg-image.jpg)Well. As I was fuming in anger, I received the most wonderful message on Twitter.A newsletter subscriber sent me a testimony about landing a dream role in tech. After she applied principles from some of the past newsletters, they offered her the job on the spot.Let me tell you the full story.She's been struggling to secure a job since last year. But it's not been easy. She gets the first interview, but never gets a call back for the next round.![not getting calls after first stage](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/3026/conversions/screenshot-2023-03-28-at-070622png-image.jpg)There's a strategy to every stage of an interview. The strategy for the introductory call is always completely different.After reading the newsletter, she saw that interviewing is a global competition. Every step of the way, your goal is to show them that you are the best person for the job.This is exactly what she did. She prepared. She studied the company. She learned as much as she could about the company, their tech stack, and mostly about the role.Thanks to all this knowledge she got to the technical assessment stage.This is when the value of ***excellence*** came in. It's a global competition, so how do you stand out ?Here's what she did:![](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/3027/conversions/screenshot-2023-03-28-at-071127png-image.jpg)And they were impressed. That's the goal. To impress the people that interview you. These people need to know you are the best person for the job.Remember that other very qualified people are also competing for this role. So whatever you can do to make a tiny different, please do it. It will be worth it.The efforts show. And people appreciate extreme levels of effort.During the next stage, she implemented one of our secret interview strategies. Finding out more about the interviewer, and keeping them happy and entertained.![](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/3028/conversions/screenshot-2023-03-28-at-074723png-image.jpg)Notice how much research she did on the product, the CTO and the company at large.This is what I do every single time, and for the past 3 years it has worked like magic.> Preparedness is the secret to winning. Not smarts, not IQ, Preparedness.That's the short and sweet story of how this 100% free newsletter helped someone land a dream role in tech.It was all her hustle and excellence, but I'm happy this newsletter could be part of that journey.I enjoyed this experience, and this is exactly what I want for you too. To go to the next level of your career.I am willing to support you every step of the way.As I write this newsletter, I'm sending a long voice note to another person who has an interview today.I'll do all this for free.
