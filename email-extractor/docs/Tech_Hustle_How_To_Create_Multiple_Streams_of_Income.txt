This is something many people don't know about my career journey.

Before I came to Nigeria in **2017**, I was a student in Russia.

I had been a software engineer for 3 years at that point. I knew I wanted to move to Nigeria and interview at Andela. This was my next big career move, but I had zero money.

How do I raise over **$6,000** for my flight, Airbnb and living expenses in Nigeria until I can land a job ?

It took me **7 months**, but I was able to raise that money as a student, thanks to the power of side gigs. It's been 5 years and counting in Nigeria.

I have hustled all the types of hustle when it comes to tech.

I have tried all of them. Failed some, and enjoyed some. And today, I am going to show you exactly the most rewarding sources of side income in tech today, and how you can get started.

**Side note**: I found an interesting project some weeks back. Fix a bug and get paid **$1,000**. Report a bug and get paid **$250**.

It's for React Frontend Engineers. Remember there's no easy money anywhere.

This is me plugging you one of my side income strategies. Don't say I didn't cut you soap.

Okay back to business. The biggest misconception about side income in tech is that it has to come fast. It's not a fast game. It's a long term game.

The Udemy courses I created 5 years ago, and have never touched since then still give me **$1,000 - $3,000** monthly in side income.

Notice that within the first 5 months, I made a total of **$0**. If I was looking for quick cash, I would have given up and moved on to something else.

But I persisted and knew I was **building for my future**, and today I lazy around and get side income every month.

A side income you start building today can save you in 2 years time when you are unexpectedly laid off. It has saved me plenty times.

Are you willing to learn proven strategies to build long term side income ?

Here are 2 tested and proven strategies to build a long term side income in tech:

1. BUILD AN AUDIENCE
--------------------

Anyone can build an audience online. It is a long term, proven strategy that can give you a huge income advantage. Every week, I email **14,000** people tips on how to grow a career in tech.

From a genuine position of wanting to help.

You don't need 10 years of experience in tech to build an audience. Budgeting 5 hours of your time a week is a great start.

Building an audience is two things:

1. Find a niche (group) of people who have the same challenges you've had in the past.
2. Help them go through that challenge and come out successful.

That's what I'm doing with this newsletter. I went through so many struggles building a career in tech, and today I'm trying to help others not go through that.

Building an audience opens you up to a ton of future side income possibilities.

You can sell online courses, provide 1 on 1 career coaching, sell digital templates, or write a book.

But it all starts with an audience of people who gain from your experience and you make their lives better.

Want to sell a course in two years time ? Build an audience now.

It's the most sustainable way to build a side income for the long term.

2. TECHNICAL WRITING
--------------------

In **2018/2019** this is what gave me about **$700 - $1,000** a month consistently. I know so many people who actually started their careers as writers.

The beauty of this is, not only does it help you grow, but it also builds evidence you can use in interviews for opportunities.

Making a side income from this will come faster than building an audience. The disadvantage is, when you stop writing, you stop getting paid.

There are many websites that'll pay you **$300 - $500** per article you write. All you need is 3 well written articles in your writing portfolio to get started.

You also do not need 10 years of experience. There are many technical articles that focus on HTML or CSS, which are entry level technologies.

To become a technical writer and pursuing this side income, follow these 4 steps:

1. Take the free [Google Technical Writing courses](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tech-hustle-how-to-create-multiple-streams-of-income)
2. Read the technical [writing Articles on Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/search/?query=technical+writing&utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=tech-hustle-how-to-create-multiple-streams-of-income)
3. Write 3 solid articles and get feedback from a seasoned technical writer
4. Apply for technical writing opportunities

Thank you for reading.

Until next week, stay growing.
