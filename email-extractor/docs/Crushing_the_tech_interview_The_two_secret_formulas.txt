I'll tell you a secret. I'm old now. So I want to transition from being a software engineer to being a developer advocate. So this year, I've been interviewing for developer advocate goals.Remember, I have ZERO years of experience as a developer advocate.I applied to about 10 jobs and got 3 invites to interview.I've rejected a $140k offer, a $70k offer and I also dropped out of an interview where I was the best candidate.That's this year alone. A 100% success rate on all my interviews.I don't want to brag, but I'm so good at interviewing. Two things make me so good.I was an interviewer for 2 years at Turing, and I have spent hundreds of hours practicing this skill.Today I will show you the secret formula that all great interviewers use to win all the time.It all comes down to these two things:![hired graphic of competent and likeable](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/3998/conversions/hired-image.png)During my time interviewing, only two things mattered:1. Is this candidate competent for the role ?2. Does this candidate have a great personality ? Do I like this candidate ?This wasn't a me thing. I once interviewed with a company that was very transparent about how they hire.They didn't have any complicated processes. It was simple.They all sat around the table and decided. A ***Hell Yeah!*** or a ***No***. Not ***Yes***, not ***Maybe***, not ***Looks Good***. Either it's a ***Hell Yeah !***, let's hire this person, or it's a no. And Everyone needed to give a ***Hell Yeah!***.This means the decision largely depended on how the interviewers liked you as a person.With this knowledge, the question becomes, how do I show the interviewers I am the most competent candidate ? And how do I make my interviewers like me as a person ?1. Show you are Competent-------------------------I have 4 different strategies to show your competence. I'll keep this letter short by showing you one. To show your interviewer you are competent, you need to:***Map your past experiences and skills to the job requirements.***I'll give you a practical example. Here are example requirements for a job, and how I would map past experiences to the job:![mapping job requirements to previous experience](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/4000/conversions/map-job-requirement-to-experience-image.png)This will guide every single question you answer.Tell me about yourself. You'll pick the requirements from the job, and highlight all your past experiences that 100% match with it.For example.Say the job description mentioned how important automated tests are to them.What you do is look for an instance in your experience where you wrote automated tests, and craft it as a significant achievement.Remember you don't need any professional experience to do this. You can CREATE your own experience.As a learner, you can write 200 automated tests for your open source project and brag about them in an interview.The interviewer can even think you're a stronger candidate because of this.Figure out exactly what your interviewer is looking for, and mapping it to your previous experiences.That how I show my competence. And that's how you can too.2. Be likeable.---------------Interviewers are human. And humans make split decisions based on how they feel. I once had an interview with a company. Because we had such a fun time interviewing, the interviewer decided to be honest with me. These were his exact words:> I really liked you, so I'll tell you this:I'll never forget that statement. The interviewer then proceeded to tell me I made it to the next round and told me what's important about winning the next round.The interviewer rooted for me. they wanted me to make it past the next stage at all costs, so they gave me some tips.That should be your goal.Nice things happen when people like you.These 5 traits will put off anyone at an interview:1. Bragging - You boast about your achievements without giving credits to your team mates or other people who helped2. Arrogance - You think you are too important and have the best abilities3. 100% perfect - You make no mistakes, and have a perfect past4. Show off - You are too good for this position and they should be glad to have you5. Nonchalance - You have many options and you don't care much about this interviewAs a takeaway from this letter, answer these two questions:1. Am I a competent candidate in every interview ?2. Do my interviewers like me at the end of the interview ?You don't have to be searching for a job to master these skills. You can master them today, and increase your chances of winning big at interviews.Thank you for reading.
