Hello ,Earlier this week someone asked me:> If these were your last moments, and you could give only one piece of advice to anyone building a career in tech, what would it be ?If you never hear from me again, here are the 3 words that should never depart from your memory:1. Career roadmap2. Excellence3. Visibility1/3 Career roadmap------------------Is your career on autopilot, or do you have a strict career roadmap you are following for the next 2 - 3 years ?I had a call with a friend and we talked about a simple career roadmap to becoming a developer advocate.Here's what we came up with for the next 12 months:![developer advocate roadmap](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/5911/conversions/screenshot-2023-07-12-at-083305-image.png)It's so simple, but yet so powerful.Define what you'll be doing for the next 2 years. Don't allow your career be blown in different directions by Twitter posts, influencers, or new frameworks and AI hype.2/3 Excellence--------------Just be good. Just be too good. There are thousands of developers all around the world. But you need to be excellent and better.Be better. Don't just learn to code. Learn how to build world class solutions to problems. There should be almost no distinction between the work you do and the work delivered by Google level software engineers.Take a look at the portfolio website someone sent to me for a job:![porfolio-website](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/5915/conversions/screenshot-2023-07-12-at-121527-image.png)The title of the site, favicon, url are not the best. No production ready website on the planet looks like this.Compare it to the Crushing Tech website:![crushing tech](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/5916/conversions/screenshot-2023-07-12-at-121926-image.png)I built this myself, and spent many hours perfecting the Search Engine Optimisation, performance, design and accuracy.Now it takes feedback to learn these things, but I want you to have a burning desire to do things the right and best way.Care a ton about the little details, and you will deliver excellent work through out your career.3/3 Visibility--------------I created a free course about React Testing, and also wrote an article on dev.to about JWT and frontend security.Here's what happened a few months after that:![linkedin-message](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/5917/conversions/screenshot-2023-07-12-at-122426-image.png)This person just reached out to me and offered me a job, including relocation to Berlin. I declined because we die here for Naija, but this was an amazing opportunity.Do great things, document them, then talk about the great things you did. That's the way to get visible. Your work, efforts and experience will speak for you even in places you can't imagine.Thank you for reading, and until next week, stay growing.[Online version](https://frantz.mailcoach.app/webview/campaign/c2870d4f-aa3d-4305-aab5-eea3d83acc01) â€¢ [Unsubscribe](https://frantz.mailcoach.app/unsubscribe/fbba01de-5bd1-468f-a377-3337dae3438e/135edbee-8f4f-4fc6-8977-04aaa548d65e) Sent by [Frantz Kati](https://twitter.com/bahdcoder?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=my-2-final-words-for-your-tech-career)
