Hello ,I've been a software engineer for 8+ years. On my career roadmap, I should be pivoting to developer advocacy this year. I've had 3 interviews so far.- Rejected 2 offers because they didn't match my expectations- For the third interview, I wasn't picked at the last stage (which I later realised the company lied, and just closed the position sigh. wasted my time.)It would have been way easier to get a role if I had prior experience as a developer advocate.So what do I do ?Cry ? Complain ? No.What we do is hustle.So this is what I did last week.I **found this really cool open source YCombinator startup** that just released their product. They have a **good product**, **good funding** and a **really strong founding team**.So I messaged them. ![message-to-yc-startup](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/6107/conversions/img-0025-image.jpg)The founder I messaged was really happy I wanted to provide value to their startup. So he replied, and we setup a call to talk more.![call-with-yc-founder](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/6108/conversions/screenshot-2023-07-19-at-071503-image.png)That call was 2 days ago.Before the call, here's what I did:1. Researched everything I could about the startup2. Learned a ton about the founders3. Used the product. Created my account, read the docs and learned how it worksI then created a developer relations strategy document for the company.![strategy-document-for-yc-startup](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/6109/conversions/screenshot-2023-07-19-at-071832-image.png)I spent over 4 hours preparing for the call. Then I created this document and presented it during the call.The next day, he sent me this message:![response-from-yc-founder](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/6110/conversions/img-0026-image.jpg)I was happy. My presentation was valuable and now I have a chance to contribute even more value to a remotely distributed team.I will continue working on this weekly and provide value in any way I can.So what's the takeaway for you ?Ask yourself these three questions:> What can I proactively do today to push your career forward ?Is there anything you can do to push your career forward ?Maybe message an open source founder and ask that you want to start writing automated tests ? Or create a design system for them ?Or just write a technical article for a start up ?> How can I provide value ?What are your strengths ? What can you do really well, and how can that benefit a project out there ?> Where are opportunities for growth ?Preparing that document helped me grow. This is a real startup with real customers and a real community.Can you find an opportunity for growth in your own career ?I hope my story, my hustle, and my experiences help you decide how you want to hustle for your own tech career.[Online version](https://frantz.mailcoach.app/webview/campaign/27278b73-31fc-4e28-af65-a1ca6d5187f4) â€¢ [Unsubscribe](https://frantz.mailcoach.app/unsubscribe/fbba01de-5bd1-468f-a377-3337dae3438e/f627c7a5-a60a-47bf-a7c0-b472d753c9ef) Sent by [Frantz Kati](https://twitter.com/bahdcoder?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=how-to-hustle-your-way-to-success-in-tech)
