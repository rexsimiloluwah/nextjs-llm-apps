I know. I'm also tired of thinking about AI and if it's going to take my job in 2 years time.![ui design for website by midjourney ai](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/4109/conversions/ai-driven-ui-design-with-midjourney-and-figma-image-2-min-image.jpg)The beautiful UI above was generated by Midjourney AI. My favourite AI.Not gonna lie. That scares me. A lot. So designers will be overthrown by AI ? And they will no longer have a place in tech ?I'll give you another example.On the Chat GPT website, the language model trained to write code can build any website. You tell it the programming language, and what you want, and it builds the thing.It's crazy.This is the same thing with data analysis tasks, backend tasks and Figma tasks.We should all go to another career. It's stressful to watch all the YouTube videos, read all the blog articles.The fuss is too much.Well. I'm going to share a different perspective.Careers in tech are not as straightforward as they look.I'll be giving you 2 reasons why you shouldn't worry about AI taking over your job anytime soon. And then I'll tell you exactly what you should be doing instead.1. Careers in tech are not that straightforward.------------------------------------------------I've read dozens of messages of people getting into tech, worried about AI. This is because a job in tech is often painted in the most beautiful light.Here's what people think it means to work in tech:As a developer, you pick up your laptop and start coding.As a designer, you open Figma and draw rectangles.A job in tech is completely different.As a developer, you don't just write code. There are so many steps that go into the process.First there's user research. Then, consideration of company resources. Understanding the market. Consideration of company goals. Then timelines, investors.All these go into the job of figuring out what code to write and when to write it.A developer's job is then to consider all these things and figure out exactly how to write the code such that it solves all these problems, while taking into consideration all the points above.So no, it's not just writing code.Same thing with the job of the designer. It's not just drawing designs on Figma.It's much more than that.User research, metrics, conversion, timelines, are a few of the things designers have to worry about.2. AI cannot create beyond existence------------------------------------Read my chat with AI this morning.![chat with ai](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/4108/conversions/untitled-collage-image.png)This is something a lot of people in tech don't realise. Every year, there's a new release of programming languages. New operating systems, new developer tools.Also, new features for tools like Figma, Python and Excel.These are tools created to help you create solutions.So there's a group of tech people researching the needs of the tech industry, and building solutions out of thin air.It's the most fascinating thing about tech. Apple released the M1 chip and it took decades of research to create. It's an impressive upgrade to computers.They did this by studying the needs of those who use computers, thinking 30 years into the future, and innovating from scratch.AI cannot innovate and create beyond what already exists today.But we can.Always remember that in all the AI stories, AI is still to, and most likely will never create something that does not exist.But every year, tech teams create non existing solutions to new problems.That's what you're for. Your job is to build innovative solutions to business problems that are even yet to exist.Well now that we've established AI will not be taking over for a long while, what do we do about AI ?You can't just ignore it. You goal is to leverage AI as a personal assistant to get your work done. These are some innovative ways you can use AI today to speed up your work:1. AI for job searching.------------------------Post the job description to Chat GPT, post your resume, and ask Chat GPT to write a great cover letter.Also, ask Chat GPT to rewrite your resume to match the job description.2. AI for daily tasks.----------------------As a developer, ask AI to help you debug errors in your code.As a designer, ask AI to suggest colour schemes for your task, and have a range to pick from.As a data analyst, give AI some sample data and ask it to write a function to normalise and clean up the data.3. AI for learning.-------------------Learning new concepts in tech and finding it hard to understand ? Use Chat GPT to create an online course for yourself, including code samples.Ask Chat GPT to explain a code sample to you like you're 5. If you don't understand, ask Chat GPT to find 3 different ways to explain again and again.Thank you for reading this newsletter. I hope you leverage AI and all it's power to make your life easier.I do everyday.             [Online version](https://frantz.mailcoach.app/webview/campaign/acdb3b5d-2391-424d-94cc-d592b2600b70) â€¢ [Unsubscribe](https://frantz.mailcoach.app/unsubscribe/fbba01de-5bd1-468f-a377-3337dae3438e/7e8b48f6-7d27-4361-b180-090f21c28be7)     Sent by [Frantz Kati](https://twitter.com/bahdcoder?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=chat-gpt-will-take-your-tech-job-heres-what-to-do)
