Hello ,In a world where there are at least **1,000 people applying for every job**, building the perfect portfolio project is one of the things that will help you stand out in the interview process.![advantages of building a real world project](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/5220/conversions/slide-3-standout-image.png)A standout portfolio project will:1. **Help you ramp up your skills with real world experience**2. **Give you stories for the interview process (Interviews are all about storytelling)**3. **Boost your chances of getting noticed amongst the competition**In this letter, I'll break down the 3 components of a standout portfolio project using a practical example.It's an extract from ***Chapter 5 of my book: Evidence driven career development***, so enjoy it.  Types of portfolio projects---------------------------  In your career in tech, there are 3 types of projects you'll be building:1. **Follow along projects**. These projects will help you learn the skills you need. You're just learning skills here, remember that. It's really good for a start, and I advice doing at least **12 follow along projects** before going to the next type of project.![follow along youtube projects](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/5221/conversions/screen-shot-2023-06-21-at-123837-image.png)2. **Practice projects**. These are the projects you see online when you search for portfolio projects. Ecommerce stores, blog, personal website, todo list, and contact forms. This type of project helps you learn how to solve already existing engineering problems. This is where you actually learn not just skills, but solutions to problems.For example, here's a problem you'll learn how to solve when building an ecommerce store practice project.How did engineers solve the ecommerce problem of too many products on the page at the same time ? ***Pagination***. So rather than displaying 1,000 products on the page, they show just 50 at a time. Now you didn't solve the problem. You just learned the solution.![pagination](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/5222/conversions/pagination-screen-size-image.png)This is again, very important for your career so you can understand a large range of existing engineering problems and how to solve them.But how do you actually get to learn how to solve new problems and ***develop problem solving skills*** ?You need to ***build a standout portfolio project***.3. **Standout portfolio projects**. A standout portfolio project takes a real world problem, and builds a solution to that problem. A standout portfolio project will push you to the edge of your skills and beyond. It will teach your brain how to solve problems, and help you develop problem solving skills.Standout portfolio project--------------------------So picture this. I am going to take an example real world problem, figure out how to solve it, and turn it into a standout portfolio project.  ### Stage 1: The real world problem  I live in Nigeria, and I see influencers sharing their bank account online everyday so their fans can support them and tip them. Influencers from other countries use apps like Cash App or Venmo, which allows fans to tip using many payment methods, and protects the influencer's private information.Here's a screenshot of the problem:![twitter account numbers](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/5217/conversions/screenshot-2023-06-21-at-115745-image.png)Fans can also participate in Giveaways just by sharing their handles.  ### Stage 2: The real world solution  We'll build an app called ***tipme.ng*** that allows everyone receive payments easily using any payment channels such as transfers, USSD, crypto, credit and debit cards, or cash deposits.Users will share their handle, for example ***@bahdcoder*** and other users can visit ***tipme.ng/@bahdcoder*** to send them any amount of money.So users will say "**Tip me ₦5,000 @bahdcoder**".Some ideas about the solution:- Downloadable from both Android and IOS stores.- Uses Paystack for FIAT payment processing and Buycoins for crypto payment processing.- Users can cash out at any time of the day with a direct deposit to their bank account.- We collect a 3% processing fee for every tip.#### How to execute the real world solutionBuilding a real world project requires understanding the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**.![sdlc](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/5223/conversions/untitled-2023-06-21-1225-image.png)1. **Founding Team / Product owner**: The person who has the business idea. Usually finds the problem to be solved, and tries to figure out a solution to the problem.2. **The Product team**. Gets the problem from the CEO, talks to customers, and creates a solution to the problem. Also guides the entire team on building the solution3. **The Design Team**: Gets the solution from the product team, and translates that into viewable and clickable prototypes.4. **The Engineering Team**: Gets the prototypes from the design team and codes them into functional working applications and websites5. **The QA Team**: Gets the application and websites from the engineering team, and tests that it solves the problem correctly, and matches the specifications from the designers, product team, and founding team.6. **The customer**: Uses the solution developed by the entire cycle, and gives feedback to the team.After the customer gives feedback, the SDLC restarts all over again with the CEO using that feedback to think about the problem again, come up with other solutions, then it goes to the product team, and so on.This is a short brief on the cycle. Developing a real world solutions requires that you bring all these pieces together.1. **Founding team**: You come up with the idea, so you're the founding team.2. **Product team**: You partner with a product manager who is just starting out their career to build this product.3. **Design team**: You partner with a product designer just starting out their career to design the solution4. **Engineering team**. You are the engineering team. If you can't do all of it, partner with someone or another person.5. **Customer**: Two people. One is a mentor, and another is a user. This mentor should have a ton of experience in the SDLC so they can provide you feedback on the entire process.Don't build your standout portfolio projects in isolation. Partner with others from the SDLC to achieve a successful product.### Standout portfolio tips- Strive for excellence. No mediocre work.- Pick an idea that is not too big, but also not too small. Ideally a standout portfolio project should take you 3 months to complete.- Write dozens of blog posts about the problems you solve, your observations working on a team and building a product- Finish the project- Buy a real domain. tipme.ng is a great example of a domain I'll buy for the idea above. It cost less than $15 for domains these days.- Follow a production checklist. Your product should use everything real teams from all over the world use to ship real products. For example, a standout portfolio project should have a well designed logo, favicon, optimised SEO, great performance, accessible, and well tested with automated tests. These are just examples of what a great production checklist looks like.- Ship the product to customers. Get customer feedback.Conclusion----------What did you learn from this segment ? How does building a standout project sound to you?Here's a secret. 5 years ago, this is the system Andela used to train world class software engineers.So if you do this, you're one step closer to being world class.[Online version](https://frantz.mailcoach.app/webview/campaign/6bb257b3-6b73-4a53-a240-589d414a448c) • [Unsubscribe](https://frantz.mailcoach.app/unsubscribe/fbba01de-5bd1-468f-a377-3337dae3438e/a5cb932a-8e5c-4489-bb7c-64c671cad256) Sent by [Frantz Kati](https://twitter.com/bahdcoder?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=the-standout-portfolio-project-how-to-sky-rocket-your-career-growth)
