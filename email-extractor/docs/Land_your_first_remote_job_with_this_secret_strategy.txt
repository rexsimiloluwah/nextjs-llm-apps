If you've been in tech in the last 2 years, you'd know that landing a job is hard. Very hard.The recession, bank runs, layoffs are making it very hard to thrive in tech now.So going to a job board and applying for a job gives you a close to impossible chance of getting one.You have to use back channels.Today I want to show you 2 back channels that work really well, but it takes time, patience, commitment and sacrifice.These are the strategies my mentees use all the time. And it works.If you're reading this email and have been in tech for up to 2 years, and have a valuable skill, this is for you. It works for designers, data scientists, developers and all.I'm looking for just 10 serious people to support through this process. If you are serious about landing a remote job, please follow these exact steps. Then, reply this email with screenshots and let's talk more.Are you ready ? Let's go.Strategy one: ***LinkedIn Cold Emailing***  Strategy two: ***Funded Open source startup***Strategy one: LinkedIn Cold Emailing------------------------------------In this strategy, we are going to leverage LinkedIn to find startups, and send emails to the startup founders.If you prefer to watch me show this strategy, there's a link at the end of this email to a short video of me showing you exactly how to do it.The secret job strategy is finding companies, not jobs. To be more specific, finding funded startup companies. Also they have to be funded, meaning they have money.This is because as a startup with less than 50 employees, decisions are made very fast. So it's easy for someone to see your value and add you to Slack, or just reply your message.Now, how do you find these companies ?Using accelerators. An accelerator is a company that invests in companies. The one we'll use today is called YCombinator. One of the most popular accelerators in the world.They also have a list of over 1,500 startups they've invested in in the past 2 years. You only need one.So how do we find these startups on LinkedIn ? Using a keyword "***yc s22***".Now go to LinkedIn. Search for "***yc s22***". This means YCombinator Summer of 2022.YC has summer and winter batches. To find companies in the winter batch of 2022, you'll search for "***yc w22***".You can also search for "***yc s21***", "***yc w21***" and so on. I recommend searching only the past 2 years. Going farther makes your request less likely to receive a reply.![Yc-s22-search-results](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/3186/conversions/yc-s22-search-image.webp)Next, click on "Companies" so the results only show companies.![YC s22 companies.

Above I picked a company called Homli.The less followers the better. Next click to view the company profile.![yc s22 company homli](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/3188/conversions/screenshot-2023-04-04-at-110027-image.webp)This Homli company has only 26 employees. Good.Select the "***people***" tab on the company profile.Scroll down to the "***People you may know***" section.In this section it'll show the employees of the company.![founders of homli highlighted](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/3189/conversions/screenshot-2023-04-04-at-095138-image.webp)Awesome. We found the founders of the company right there.There are usually two or more founders.Next we need to send them an InMail. An InMail is a premium service on LinkedIn that allows you to send a mail to anyone on the network. Don't worry, you can sign up for a free trial for LinkedIn Premium and get 15 free InMail credits.This is an example email to send to any of the founders:![inmail to homli founder](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/3191/conversions/screenshot-2023-04-04-at-100046-image.webp)The key here is stating that your focus is not money for now, but you're willing to put in the work to prove to them you are worth it.If you work with them for 3 months and they see how hard you work, now you have some leverage to make an ask.I've seen this strategy work for so many people, but you need to send at least 10 - 15 InMails to different startups.Wait for the replies. As you wait, move on to strategy two.Strategy two: Funded open source startups-----------------------------------------In this strategy, we find open source startups and start contributing to their products.This is my most favourite strategy because so little people do it, but it has worked 100% of the time.I'll even show you a recent mentee of mine who used this to slide into a company and is now actively contributing to their product.It's a 3 step process:1. Find an open source funded startup company2. Engage and contribute3. Make an askIf you prefer to watch me show this strategy, there's a link at the end of this email to a short video of me showing you exactly how to do it.  ### 1. Find an open source funded startup company  To find startups, we'll use YCombinator also. This time, we'll go to the YCombinator website instead. Then, we'll find only the open source companies they have invested in.Now this is the secret link:[https://www.ycombinator.com/companies?batch=W23&tags=Open Source](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies?batch=W23&tags=Open+Source&utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=land-your-first-remote-job-with-this-secret-strategy)Notice the batch in the URL. It's W23 (Winter 2023). We can switch this to S22 or W22 if we wish. Let's start with W23.First, visit that link. You'll see all the open source startups that YC funded in the specified batch.![yc open source companies](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/3192/conversions/screenshot-2023-04-04-at-110909-image.webp)You can do this with any of the startups on the list.As an example, click on the first result. It's Moon repo. On the company profile page, you'll see a link to their website.![moonrepo company profile. website highlighted](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/3193/conversions/screenshot-2023-04-04-at-111028-image.webp)Follow their website. From their website scroll down to the footer. You'll see a link to the Discord, Github and Twitter.![moonrepo website footer. social links highlighted](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/3194/conversions/screenshot-2023-04-04-at-111211-image.webp)  ### 2. Engage and contribute  First, visit the Github. Confirm that you are proficient in the programming language they use. Also, make sure you understand what they are doing.Another key thing to look for here is a small bug or fix you can work on for a start.Then it's time to join the Discord and introduce yourself. This is the exact strategy a mentee of mine used.This is actually her exact message in the discord:![mentee message on discord introducing themselves](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/3197/conversions/screenshot-2023-04-04-at-102130-image.png)Notice at the bottom that someone replied. They exchanged over 10 messages. That person is the cofounder of the startup.Excellent. Now she's working with them and has already raised her first pull request. They've been very supportive, and giving her help whenever she asks.  ### 3. Make an ask  After you've contributed at least 3 pull requests to an open source project, it's time to make an ask. This ask will be simple and strategic.You'll ask them if you can join in on weekly team calls. You'll say you're a newbie, and you'd love to have the full software engineering team experience.They are most likely to say yes since they know you and see what you bring to the table.This is what brings you to the inner circle.In 3 months, I guarantee you this team will be very open to giving you a stipend of $1k - $2k when you ask for it.It just takes time, patience, and sacrifice.Well. Those are the two strategies. It's not easy, I know. But THEY WORK. Finally you have something that works.Will you use it? Or not ?I am looking for just 10 serious people who will do these strategies, and reply to this email with screenshots.If you do, I will personally support you on your journey until you successfully start earning some money from this.Waiting on your screenshots !Also, here's a link to watch a practical guide showing you these strategies.[Link to watch these 2 strategies practically](https://www.loom.com/share/392020c03a334b9f850c39498b87cc0e?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=land-your-first-remote-job-with-this-secret-strategy)             [Online version](https://frantz.mailcoach.app/webview/campaign/801780cf-bcaa-4c7d-abe1-ac55700f7473) â€¢ [Unsubscribe](https://frantz.mailcoach.app/unsubscribe/fbba01de-5bd1-468f-a377-3337dae3438e/87ba471f-9905-48c4-9ff2-d94727e8a2ba)     Sent by [Frantz Kati](https://twitter.com/bahdcoder?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=land-your-first-remote-job-with-this-secret-strategy)
