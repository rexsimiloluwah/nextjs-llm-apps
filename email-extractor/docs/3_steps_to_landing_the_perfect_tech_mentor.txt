When I realised I badly needed a mentor, I started reaching out to industry leaders in whatever way I could to get one.Remember my career was in two phases ? Phase 1 where I spent 4 years doing nothing I loved, stressing, and making zero progress.Phase 2 where I learned the deep secrets of tech and how to make a 360 turn around for my career.One of those secret ingredients to improving my life in tech was finding the perfect mentor.I spent 4 years trying to become successful in the tech field without a degree and without a mentor. 4 Years.That was the most naive decision I have ever made. And frankly, I don't blame myself. No one told me.A lot of the things I took 4 years to learn would have taken me 1 month if I hade a mentor. That's a huge difference.I'll give you an example of why a mentor is the most critical part of your career.Back in 2016, I started creating courses on Udemy. I created my first course about PHP and Laravel.I was so happy. I shared with all my friends. But, after 6 months, I got only 100+ students. What ?!I knew my course was excellent, because I put my heart and soul into it, but 100 students ? That was so bad. I noticed others with the same course as me were having 50,000+ students.After doing research for months and months, I realised the secret. Udemy students were not coming from Udemy.Udemy students were coming from YouTube! What ! The person with the best performing PHP Udemy course had a YouTube channel where he shared a discount to his Udemy course.I was angry. All this time wasted. I immediately started a YouTube channel. In less than a year I had 10,000+ students on that course. And I created many more courses. Now I have 75,000 total students on Udemy.Now here's where things get interesting.Back in 2020, a young Nigerian reached out to me on Twitter and asked me how he could create courses and get many students.Guess the first thing I told him. I gave him golden advice. I told him: "Start by finding students, then proceed to creating a course".That was the secret strategy that would have saved me 12+ months of pain, no results, sadness and self doubt.Just because this guy met me, he learned it in 5 minutes. I was even pained when I was sending him the free voice note.That's the value of a mentor. You get to benefit from years of experience without having to make the same mistakes.I'm sure you know why having a mentor is invaluable to your career.In this letter, I'm going to show you 3 simple steps to landing the perfect mentor for your career in tech1. Make a list of potential mentors2. Provide value3. Reach out and ask1. Make a list of potential mentors-----------------------------------What are the top 3 career goals you have ? Some examples are:1. Relocating abroad as a software engineer2. Working for big tech companies as a product manager3. Earning $100k+ as a remote product designerThese are all valid and possible goals. You need to find a mentor that has either achieved these goals before, or has the proven potential to help you achieve them.Example.I met someone who wanted to become top 1% of designers and move to Canada. She was very talented.She had a mentor. Her mentor believed that anyone in tech saying they work for international companies is a scammer.What a mindset. Even though I'm sure her mentor had a lot of good things about her, this one thing meant she had zero experience landing remote or relocation jobs.And thus her mentor would never be able to help her achieve her dream.Now write down a list of 5 people you think would make a great mentor for you and your goals.There are many ways to find potential mentors for your goals.Twitter, LinkedIn, your personal network, attending tech events (virtual and in person).The perfect mentor is probably not the person posting all the time on Social Media. They could also be a founder of a tech firm. Or, a speaker at conferences. Or, someone who volunteered for a good cause.Sometimes, it's someone who got featured on a YouTube channel about something they achieved.These are all valuable ways to find that perfect mentor.The key here is to remember two things that make the perfect mentor:1. They have achieved at least 50% of the dreams you have2. They have the potential to guide you on how to achieve all your dreams2. Provide value----------------Okay. You have a list of 5 solid people you think would make great long term mentors for your career.How do you convince them to invest a few hours of their time every month talking to you ?This is where 99% of people get it wrong.Don't go ask them to be your mentor. They don't know you. They've never heard of you. They don't know your story.It's like moving up to a girl you've never met before and proposing.It can't work. It'll rarely work.So here's what to do instead.Provide value to them.Most people aren't just doing one thing in their career.The 5 people you wrote down might be into YouTube content creation, article writing, posting on Twitter, or speaking on podcasts.They have a goal they're working on achieving. Providing value means finding out what goal they're working on, and figuring out how you can help achieve that goal.I'll give you an example. I write a weekly newsletter. Every week you send me a list of 5 newsletter topics I could write about, with metrics based evidence that they will perform well.That's crazy valuable.Another one. Here's a lesson from Benjamin on Twitter. He's been following me on Twitter and constantly supporting my content for the past few months now.See his timeline:![benjamin timeline on Twitter](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/3542/conversions/fnjmrl9xgamwpw6-image.jpeg)This is him providing value to me without asking for anything in return. Now guess what ! I know his name now. I know who he is. If he asked me for a 30 minutes call, I'm 100 times more likely to say yes than someone else I've never heard about.Some potential mentors might be organising events. Compile a list of top ten venues in Lagos, with different prices and send to them.Some might be public speakers. Compile a list of 5 events that are like where they usually talk. Send them 5 topic proposals based on their expertise.Do you get the idea? There's something valuable you can do to get yourself noticed by this person.First you get known by providing value. This softens the person's heart towards you, and gives you a much better ground to make an ask.3. Reach out and ask--------------------You've had several interactions with your potential mentor online, or at several in person events. Point is, you're not a stranger. Good. Now you want to make a formal ask.This could be by sending an email, or asking at an in person event.Your ask needs to be direct and explicit. What do you want ? And what does mentorship mean ?Here are some not so good requests I've received from total strangers:1. Mentor me. I will be coming to your house everyday for training.2. Please be my mentor. Just 1 hour of your time every day to teach me.3. Please mentor me and show me the way.4. I face too many Javascript bugs. Please mentor me and solve these bugs for me every time I have an issue.You have to be very considerate, and make a realistic ask. This is an example of an ask that I would personally consider:> Please give me 30 minutes to 1 hour of your time every month. I will compile a list of everything I am doing for my career (online courses, meet up events, twitter spaces, etc), and will create an agenda for our call.> > I will create a progress report and plan for the next month and present to you during our monthly call, and ask for your feedback.That's it. That's a great ask, and it's going to give you so much impact in your career.As you build a relationship with this person, they could do more for you at their convenience. This could involve applying for job postings with you, or doing live interview prep sessions.It all becomes more natural later on.That's it from me this week.Stay growing, and I hope you're ready for my career changing book. You'll love it when it's ready.             [Online version](https://frantz.mailcoach.app/webview/campaign/1197a35a-438e-42c0-9c71-d92bbfd324f1) â€¢ [Unsubscribe](https://frantz.mailcoach.app/unsubscribe/fbba01de-5bd1-468f-a377-3337dae3438e/31c5ff72-4471-4af7-9fee-42d43382171f)     Sent by [Frantz Kati](https://twitter.com/bahdcoder?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=3-steps-to-landing-the-perfect-tech-mentor)
