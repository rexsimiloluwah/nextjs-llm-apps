Hello ,I've mentored 100+ developers over the years, and there's a dark time that every single one of them have experienced:> The Time Between Gaining Your Skills And Landing A Tech JobThis is the darkest time you'll ever experience. You just completed 4 courses on frontend engineering. You have built so many projects. You're ready to start applying for entry level jobs.Then it hits you.Stagnation.*****50 jobs applied, 35 rejections, 15 didn't even respond*****.It almost seems like your decision to get into tech was a very wrong one.I will tell you exactly how to overcome this darkest phase in your career.Before that, here are **3 things you definitely shouldn't do**:1. Switch career paths----------------------![chat-on-twitter-about-transitioning-to-backend-and-machine-learning](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/6604/conversions/screenshot-2023-08-02-at-040227-image.png)Please do not think switching your career path will give you more opportunities. It'll just confuse you more. Everyone is having a really hard time landing a job. Switching to AI will not make your chances any better.As a frontend engineer, thinking you might **get more frontend opportunities** if you learn **UI / UX** design is a mistake.2. Free work for equity and no pay----------------------------------![work-for-equity](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/6605/conversions/3-image.png)Just last week someone reached out to me. A company was asking him to build their entire application, but the terms of the contract were:- No pay or stipend- Free work for equity, with no contracts yet (Company is not registered)- One man operation, no existing engineering team99% of the time, you want to avoid such deals. You think they will help you grow. They won't.You think you'll gain real world experience. You won't.If you get such an opportunity in future, check the following:- The business is registered and has a great business model- The founder has prior business experience- There are potential real customers for the business- Engineering is not the only department. There are huge efforts in other departments such as marketing, sales and funding.3. Give up or pause tech------------------------This is the easiest mistake to make. Because you applied for so many jobs but got no replies, you stop applying altogether and give up on your dreams. You slow down.Do not slow down.Nothing beats consistency.When you started your job hunt, you sent out **5 applications a day**. Now because things are hard, you barely apply to 2 per day anymore.This is a really easy mistake to make. Make sure you don't.> Now here are the 3 things you should absolutely be doing while waiting to land your next job in tech:1. Contributing to Open Source------------------------------Mentee of mine started learning to code in January of 2022.**Jan 2022 - Dec 2022**: Learning to code, building tons of practice projects**Dec 2022 - March 2023**: Building realworld portfolio project heyme.io**March 2023 - July 2023**: Contributing to Highlight.io open source project every single day**Aug 2023**: Landed **Fullstack Engineering Internship at Mono** (Was one of the ~7 interns picked out of 2,000 applicants)The secret to how she was top 0.003% of applicants and landed an internship in less than 2 years into tech: Open Source.Because she had a **consistent track record contributing to open source**, she had a solid set of skills and experiences to convince the interviewers that she'll be a great fit for Mono.Her resume was not empty anymore. It had **open source contributions** and an outstanding portfolio project to backup her experience.Not only that, but open source gives you the energy you need to not give up on your career.Contributing daily, interacting with very talented people all over the world will give you a strong foundation for your career and **keep your energy pumping until you land that job**.If you haven't started with open source, take my 100% free course to get started in less than an hour.[Link to the 100% free open source course](https://www.crushingit.tech/courses/open-source/what-is-open-source-with-examples?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=the-darkest-time-of-your-tech-career-and-how-to-overcome-it)2. Build Your Portfolio Project-------------------------------The best portfolio projects can be transformed into actual businesses.Take a look at this portfolio website:![coverai.co](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/6608/conversions/wwwcoveraico-image.png)This is a portfolio project that is solving a real problem for real paying customers, has real pricing, with all systems working and functional to 100%.If you were interviewing candidates, would you hire someone with this quality of project in their portfolio ? Or another person that showed you a weather app ?Your portfolio project should:- **Be top quality**. Look exactly like any other startup out there- **Beautifully designed** and fully responsive- Have a **real world use case**- **Fully functional** for real world customers- Be able to **turn into a business**How do you build such a top quality project ? I highly recommend assembling a team:- **Product designer** to create a custom responsive design that looks amazing- **Software engineers** to build the solution- **Product manager** to research and coordinate product development- **Experienced mentor** to give you feedback on building the product3. Make a side income---------------------I had a fun chat with someone a few weeks ago. She's a student living in the northern part of Nigeria. She started a career in tech ~9 months ago, and has already **made $5k+ USD** writing technical articles online.> Technical writing is still the best way to make a side income in techYou can make anywhere from **$300 - $1,000** a month writing articles online.3 simple steps to get started:- Take the free [Google Technical writing course](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=the-darkest-time-of-your-tech-career-and-how-to-overcome-it)- Write 5 solid articles for a free publication like Freecodecamp: This will create a writing portfolio for you that you'll use to apply for jobs. You'll also get free feedback on your writing before publication.- Apply to technical writing jobsWrite 2 articles a month and do this consistently until you land your next job.---Getting a job in tech isn't easy. But it doesn't have to be sad. You can be pumped with energy and doing a ton for your career while you wait for someone to give you a chance.I hope this email gives you a ton of ideas on how to make your job hunt less dark, and use that time to push your career forward.Thank you for reading.[Online version](https://frantz.mailcoach.app/webview/campaign/74977364-483b-4c26-bc3c-c0814afb9507) â€¢ [Unsubscribe](https://frantz.mailcoach.app/unsubscribe/fbba01de-5bd1-468f-a377-3337dae3438e/23ba5003-8ed0-4743-8c52-f1b4aed10fc2) Sent by [Frantz Kati](https://twitter.com/bahdcoder?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=the-darkest-time-of-your-tech-career-and-how-to-overcome-it)
