I'm writing a book. Not too big, not too small. But it's a career changing book. I hope you read it when it's done.I made one big mistake when I started my career in tech. It cost me 4 years of turning around with no progress.> I spent 4 years learning to code instead of building a career in software engineeringAnd this does not only apply to software engineers.*I've met designers who are learning to use Figma instead of building a career in product design.**I've met others who are learning to use AWS instead of building a career in cloud engineering.*It cost me 4 years of my career. And I don't want the same thing to happen to you.To build a career, you need to think like a business owner. 75% of business people fail because they lack one of three things:1. **A good product**2. **A good marketing strategy**3. **A good sales strategy**Let's say I make and sell cars like Elon Musk.First, I need to make an amazing car. That's a good product.Next, I need everyone who buys cars to know that I made or am making a good car. That needs a good marketing strategy.Finally, I need to convince any one that shows interest in buying a car that this is the best car for them. That needs a good sales strategy.If any of these 3 core components are missing in your business, your business will fail.Now how does this apply to your career?1. **You are the product**. Your hardcore skills like coding, design, research, or data analysis.2. **Your network and who knows about you** is your marketing strategy3. **Your ability to sell yourself in interviews or opportunities** is your sales strategy.Without a good product, no matter how good your network is, you'll never be able to make progress in your career.Without a good marketing strategy, you might never get a chance at an interview or opportunity.Without the ability to sell yourself, you might never pass stage one of any interview. You also may never get opportunities like joining programs or speaking at conferences.My biggest career mistake is that I focused all my energy learning to code. I didn't know I had to build myself as a good product.I didn't know I had to to build my network. I didn't know I had to teach myself how to interview, how to grab opportunities, and how to convince people to give me a chance.I hope this is the wake up call you need so you don't make the same mistakes I made. Don't waste 4 years like I did.Stay growing.
