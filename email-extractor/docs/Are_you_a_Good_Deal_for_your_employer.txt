Hello ,First with an update on the open source course. It's almost ready to ship.I tried editing some of the content but it's a lot. So I've sent it out to a video editor to help me out.I promise you'll enjoy the content, and learn a ton from it.Someone who read my previous newsletters on getting into open source sent me this last week:![slack-congratulations](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/4459/conversions/1-1-1-image.png)The team is congratulating her. She's building tons of experience, and creating meaningful connections.Also, she's setting herself up for a more successful career.That's what I want for you. Course is coming out real soon, I promise.And also almost done with the book. This letter today is a snippet from a chapter.Now back to today's letter.Are you a great deal for your employer ?========================================Software engineers are expensive. Designers are even more expensive. Data scientists as well.Most roles in tech pay very well.A few years ago, I joined a **San Francisco** based startup as a **Frontend Engineer.**They were building a **Shopify app**.Shopify helps merchants create e-commerce stores online. The startup was building an app that helps Shopify merchants deliver products to customers faster.When I joined the team, there was a ***product designer on board***. His job was to create designs, while I implement them on the frontend.So two weeks into the process, I noticed that we were moving too slow. The **CEO was complaining** about customers waiting for the product.The **CTO was also not very happy with the progress**.I was moving as fast as I can, but we had to create components from scratch like custom drop downs, slides and pop ups.It's time consuming.So I took some time to do some research, and came up with a solution.I had a meeting with the CTO.I made 2 recommendations to him:1. We're spending too much time on creating new components for the design system. It's not worth it in the long run. It doesn't add any value to our end customers. They don't care.My recommendation to this problem was to **stop designing custom components**. The designer was designing very complicated components, which were impressive, but not necessary.2. We shouldn't even need a designer in the first place. We're a technology startup, and Shopify already created a design system for creating Shopify apps.My recommendation was to **let the designer go**, and **use the Shopify design system** . This was going to save us at least 20 hours a week in engineering time (my time), so I could focus on building features, not UI components.This was also going to save us **$100k+** a year spent on a designer that wasn't providing the biggest of business value.The CTO took my second recommendation.A sad one. Someone had to lose their job. But at that stage of the company, they weren't providing the amount of value it cost the company to pay them.Was I a great deal for my employer ?They were spending about **$80k per year** hiring me.In less than two weeks, I helped save them **$100k+** based on my experience and recommendations.I also cut down engineering time by half, and shipped features much faster to customers.This ended up bringing them more customers and thus more money.What does this mean ? It means to this employer, I was an amazing deal.They spent $80k per year hiring me, and in turn made **$300k+ in customer billings**.That's worth it.Now why did I share this ?Because this is the six figure mindset I came to realise many years into my software engineering career.Here's the one I have for you:Help your employer make more money----------------------------------If you cannot explain how you help your employer make more money every year, there's a problem.Either the work you do is not very valuable for the business, or you're not looking at the right things.As someone in tech, everyday you wake up, ask yourself this:What can I do to make my employer more money?This question actually get's answered in subtle ways. Sometime in the past, I worked on a team and I noticed engineers spent at least 2 days out of their week fixing bugs.Sometimes, customer support will distract an engineer for 2 whole hours trying to fix a customer bug.The problem was simple. This application has too many bugs.It's slowing us down so we don't ship fast enough, and most of all we're losing customers and losing money.I came up with an action plan that included **writing tests** and **building a Quality Assurance team**. I took it to my team lead.And in the end, it helped the company save lots of money.As a designer, you can do this too. As a technical writer, you can identify problems that will save your employer money, or make them more.That's been it for today.I hope you enjoyed this one.Until next week, stay growing.             [Online version](https://frantz.mailcoach.app/webview/campaign/f47abee1-c3ab-44fc-8f8a-788f9302ffdd) â€¢ [Unsubscribe](https://frantz.mailcoach.app/unsubscribe/fbba01de-5bd1-468f-a377-3337dae3438e/087265ad-58fb-4a38-b105-402e051e3423)     Sent by [Frantz Kati](https://twitter.com/bahdcoder?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=are-you-a-good-deal-for-your-employer)
