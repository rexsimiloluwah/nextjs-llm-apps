Hey ,It's finally here. The Complete Guide To Getting Started With Open Source.It's a 3 part course (4 parts for software engineers), and will take you ~30 minutes to complete.Open source completely transformed my life as a software engineer, and I strongly believe it can do the same for you too.[Watch The Course for Free Here](https://www.crushingit.tech/courses/open-source/what-is-open-source-with-examples?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=3-popular-job-interview-questions-and-how-to-ace-them)Now back to today's newsletter.  ---I've rejected 3 job offers this year. This means I successfully completed 3 interview processes and landed a job offer.True story. I am extremely confident in my interviewing skills. This is because of 2 reasons:1. I spent countless hours practicing how to interview on YouTube and infront of my mirror2. I spent almost 2 years on the other side of the table. I was an interviewer for tech talent at Turing, so I know how companies find and evaluate the best candidates.This puts me at an unfair advantage.If you're very going into an interview, you need to read this email.I will outline 3 questions that will show up in almost any interview, and exactly how you should answer these questions (+ sample answers from my past interviews).Always remember the ultimate secret to acing any interview:> **Prepare ALL your answers before you walk into the interview. It's a game. Never go unprepared.**For these 3 questions, we'll be interviewing for the role of **Remote Visual Content Creator** at a company called Pixellu. This is a real job and a real description:![job description for remote visual content creator at Pixellu](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/4899/conversions/screenshot-2023-06-07-at-030643-image.png)  1. Tell me about yourself-------------------------  The goal of this question is to get a sense of your past experiences, and see if they align perfectly with what the company is looking for.To answer correctly, talk about your previous experience and **EXACTLY** how it relates to this job.Then, talk about your **FUTURE** goals and **EXACTLY** how this job will help you get there.**Example answer**:> Two years ago when I joined Simfex (where I currently work), we were about to launch the biggest update to our mobile application. The CEO walked up to me and said, we're counting on you big for this one.> This was because I was in charge of creating all the graphics in Adobe Photoshop, animations in Adobe After Effects, and editing marketing campaign videos using Adobe Premiere Pro.> We had a successful launch, and accumulated a total of 800,000 impressions accross all social media.> I later went on to work at Akary where I was in charge of coming up with marketing strategy and design ideas. I helped them launch a successful short form video marketing campaign on Tik Tok that got over 400,000 views in the first week.> For the future, my goal is to get more into the marketing strategy of the business, while still being the best content creator on tools like Adobe Premiere Pro, Youtube and Tik tok Shorts, and I strongly believe Pixellu is going to help me achieve that goal.Notice that in my answer, I mentioned a range of all editing tools I use such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe After Effects and Adobe Photoshop. It's not a coincidence that the job description mentions that ALL of these tools are required.When answering this question, mention all the skills you have that overlap with the skills required in the job description.Also notice how I mention 1 major achievement from my previous jobs ? This is very important. It's an opportunity to show that you are result oriented and have helped businesses achieve success in the past.2. What are your strengths ?----------------------------This question can show up in different forms. It can be asked as:1. What are your greatest career achievements ?2. Why are you the best person for this job ?The answer to all these questions revolve around one thing:> Show the company how you will bring them value or make them more moneyHere's an example response to this question:> My greatest strength is understanding and breaking down the problems faced by a business, and coming up with a creative solution to solve that problem. I did this really well at Akary, where I found out that what we needed was more social media engagement.> I proceeded to propose a strategy for creating more engaging Tik Tok videos by adding more Premiere Pro effects and using more interactive short video ideas. It led to a 40% increase in our total engagement in just 6 months.> If given the chance to work at Pixellu, this is the same problem solving mindset and creativity I'll be bringing to the table.Always end your answers with a practical example and make sure it's focused on results for the business. That's why you need to prepare all these stories before you walk into the interview.3. Why do you want to work at this company ?--------------------------------------------The goal of this question is to test 2 things:1. Have you done proper research about our company ?2. Do our values and future goals align with yours ?I went ahead to research about the company values and origin.Pixellu helps photographers create albums online. Pixellu started with 2 wedding photographers, and their core values are: **Beauty, Simplicity**, and **Reliability**.Using this information I found out from the company website, here's how I would craft out a perfect answer:> There are two reasons why I was extremely excited to apply for this position:> > 1. Your values of reliability and simplicity 100% align with my personal values. I strongly believe the best solutions to problems are simple, and reliable people build reliable companies.> When I work at a company, I want that company to trust me to deliver on simple and beautiful solutions to the business problems.> 2. I come from a small town where content creators are not very popular.> To see 2 amazing wedding photographers build a huge company like Pixellu really motivates me and shows me that there's a lot of room for me to grow at Pixellu.That's it. This is how I ace interviews and land offers from companies all over the world.This is how I do it, and this is exactly how you can impress interviewers from all over the world even with little or no experience.Thank you for reading. Until next week, stay growing.[Online version](https://frantz.mailcoach.app/webview/campaign/cdbde759-58b2-4eab-ac6d-fd5eb4c9cbce) â€¢ [Unsubscribe](https://frantz.mailcoach.app/unsubscribe/fbba01de-5bd1-468f-a377-3337dae3438e/6331c978-fbb7-42cd-823d-ba3e09655a1d) Sent by [Frantz Kati](https://twitter.com/bahdcoder?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=3-popular-job-interview-questions-and-how-to-ace-them)
