Five years ago I made a huge mistake at work. Almost got me fired. And it was my very first remote work experience. This was during my time at Andela.At Andela, after about 6 months of joining, you get to join a real partner project. I joined a project called Shiftboard as a frontend engineer.They were all based in Seattle. My friend Kayode and I were the only ones from Nigeria.I was a React wizard already by that time so the coding was going great.On one beautiful Friday, I got a message on Slack from a product manager. He said "Hey Frantz, can you check out this JIRA issue ?".It was a bug reported by an important customer.I answered "Sure. I'll do so now". After checking it out, I went home. In my mind, this issue was easy and I'll fix it first thing in the morning.Okay I didn't go home. It was Friday. we all went to watch Avengers.Came back to my Slack on Monday and during the morning call, the product manager calls me out and says some painful things.He said I don't care about customers, I ignored him on Slack, I didn't give him feedback.Ah. Omo.My first remote job.Then it hit me. All I needed to do to avoid all this wahala was tell him I was going to work on it on Monday.That way he'll tell the customer to wait till Monday.It was hot. He notified Andela about what happened, and Andela had to call me and ask me questions about why a partner was angry.This was just one mistake. But I'm very sure the customer was giving hell to the product manager too. So the hell transferred to me.I explained and explained.But I learned a very valuable lesson.> Over communication is the best way to ever avoid a people problem at work.Until then, I kept hearing communication, but didn't know how valuable it was.One of my personal values became over communication.How do I use it ? Three ways.1. I double ask every doubt I have.-----------------------------------If you send me a message and ask me to work on something, I'll ask for a deadline, the goal and the scope.I'm not taking any chances. Even after you explain, I'll thank you for explaining. Then I'll say it back to you just to confirm that I got the right things.Great communication requires listening and comprehending. I listen very well to what you have to say. Then I double check that what I comprehended is exactly what you meant.Don't take chances. People will notice when you become a great communicator. And they'll appreciate it.2. I give regular updates, even when not asked----------------------------------------------I was doing a freelance project for a client sometime ago. After kick off, the next day I sent an email telling him all I had done.Two days later, I sent another email. Every two days I sent in an update communicating what I had done and how much was left.He was shocked. In his 3 years of hiring freelancers, he had never met someone who was so accountable and responsive. People appreciate when you tell them what's going on and not leave them in the dark.3. I show gratitude and kindness--------------------------------Most of my work is directly with a design team. Sometimes, I ask for an update.When the design team makes the update, I say thank you.I don't stop there. During a daily call, I mention that I asked for an update and the design team was graceful enough to give it to me. And I say thank you again.From time to time, I post on Slack and say "Shoutout to design team for helping me resolve this". I mention the name of the person that worked on this.I'm not only verbal about the things I need. I communicate gratitude and kindness as much as I can.People see your kindness. People appreciate being appreciated.Being kind and grateful at the workplace will help you win people over.I've got a gift for you.Here's a free online course that will take you less than 2 hours to complete, but will boost your communication skills and get you ready for the workplace.[Link to the Free LinkedIn Communication Course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/communication-foundations-2?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=how-i-almost-got-fired-because-of-communication)Thank you for reading.
