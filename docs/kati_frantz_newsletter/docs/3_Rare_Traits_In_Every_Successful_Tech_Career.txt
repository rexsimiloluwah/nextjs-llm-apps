Hello ,3 years ago I worked at Turing, and I was part of the team recruiting developers. I've also consulted with global engineering teams in the past 2 years.These two things have given me a chance to evaluate and observe tons of developers, how they work, and how they build their careers.I've observed dozens of successful people in tech, and these are the top 6 rare traits that have made them successful:1/3 Niche down and Specialise-----------------------------Career success is not only about doing your job, closing your laptop and getting paid. It's beyond that. It's about creating an impact in the industry over time.The more time you spend on your career, the more impact you can create.The tech industry is very large, so to create huge impact, you have to niche down and pick a specialty.A niche is a specific problem you are excited about solving.I'll give you some examples:- **@Samson\_Goddy** : Niched down to being an open source advocate. Proceeded to create the biggest open source community in Africa- **@AdoraNwodo**: Niched down to cloud engineering and technologies. Proceeded to write 2 books about the cloud.- **@IkegahRuth**: Niched down to community leadership. Proceeded to organise the biggest open source conference in Africa, become a Github Star, and lead community at Chaoss Africa.What are you passionate about ? I advice niching down even more. The more you specialise and master a specific area, the more impact you can create not just at your company, but for the tech community globally.> Don't niche down to being a frontend engineer. Niche down to being a frontend engineer specialising in application performance.> Don't niche down to being a backend engineer. Niche down to being a backend engineer specialising in database query optimisation.2/3 Aggressive value contributor--------------------------------What can you do to create more impact? Both at your workplace and in the community ?I used to work at a company where customers reported at least 5 new bugs a day. We'd have one developer dedicated to fixing bugs each day. The bugs just kept coming.I decided to take the initiative and create a test suite for the frontend and backend application. Every weekend, I would write around 20 tests. In about 2 months I had over **300 tests written for the application**.I then automated testing on Github Actions. As time went by, the number of reported bugs kept reducing.No one asked me to do this. No one assigned me to it.I saw an opportunity to provide value. So I was **proactive**, took **ownership**, put in the work, and contributed tremendous value to my team at the workplace.To be a high value contributor, be:- **Proactive**- **Take ownership**- **Strive for impact**Here are some more practical examples of people who have contributed a ton of value:- **@unicodeveloper**: Created and led multiple dev communities in Africa like ForLoop Africa. Proceeded to become an open source developer advocate (even as he runs his own startup)- **@Dominus\_Kelvin**: Contributed to SailsJS framework for the past 3 years and later proceeded to become global core maintainer.3/3 Growth Mindset------------------Gone are the days when the most talented were the biggest winners. Today, it's the most hardworking that win.Here are some rules to cultivate a growth mindset:1. The amount of success and achievements you get in your career depends on how much of the ***right hard work you put in***. Not your talents.2. Constructive criticism is the fuel you need to build a better career. Never miss a chance to get feedback about how you speak, work, write, code, collaborate, or respond in situations. Seek feedback at all times and in all situations.3. Measure your improvements and failures. Don't go through your career blindly. Every month, sit down with yourself. Review your progress, review your short comings. Be conscious about where you are, and where you want to go.Summary-------Let these 3 things fuel you into building a successful career in technology.- Niche down and specialise to create more impact- Contribute value aggressively in any way you can- Develop a growth mindset for continuous improvement[Online version](https://frantz.mailcoach.app/webview/campaign/6ec55ada-359a-4f95-a6d8-175de1909390) â€¢ [Unsubscribe](https://frantz.mailcoach.app/unsubscribe/fbba01de-5bd1-468f-a377-3337dae3438e/44ad09af-9e13-4fa5-a593-e3606632c598) Sent by [Frantz Kati](https://twitter.com/bahdcoder?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=3-rare-traits-in-every-successful-tech-career)
