Hello ,There's a dark reality going on in the tech industry that no one else is talking about.In this newsletter I'm going to explain to you exactly what it is, but where did this all begin ?Mono is hiring interns----------------------If you don't already know, **Mono** is hiring for their Summer Internship programme. Mono is a big tech company in Nigeria. It's prestigious, high quality, and a dream company for anyone to work at.Last week they announced their summer internship programme on Twitter and here's what happened:![mono ceo tweet](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/5072/conversions/mono-image-image.png)In less than 1 hour, ***960 people*** applied for an internship. That's a lot !And they most likely won't take up to 10 people.Not only that.The ***job posting crashed because of too much traffic***. That means hundreds more were trying to apply but couldn't.That's when I started digging.Alt school.-----------Alt school is simply the best way to get into tech in 2023. I recommend it to every single person that reaches out to me.And I love them.Here's what happened last year:![alt school registrations](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/5073/conversions/screenshot-2023-06-14-at-095914-image.png)They had a huge success. ***8,000 people applied*** for a paid school. I can't confirm how many of these are Nigerians, but my personal observation says a lot of them are.That's not all.Alx Africa.-----------Also a very popular way of getting into tech in 2023.How many students do they currently have enrolled ?Here's a screenshot of their Slack Community for enrolled students:![](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/5074/conversions/img-5344-image.jpeg)***74,637 students !!!***That's a lot of people getting into tech, most of which are Nigerians from my observations.Now here's where things get interesting.The job market--------------I did a search to find out how many tech jobs are available in the market for all these people.I did my first search on **Indeed**.Here's the number of software engineering jobs currently open in Nigeria:![software engineer search on indeed](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/5077/conversions/screen-shot-2023-06-14-at-100920-image.png)Only ***376 open jobs*** for software engineers. And ***less than 5%*** of those are looking for people with ***no experience***.Here's the number of ui designer jobs currently open in Nigeria:![ui designer search on indeed](https://mailcoach.mailcoach.de-fra1.upcloudobjects.com/8aba450d-80f3-4a9e-ad63-c591a99e4788/5078/conversions/screen-shot-2023-06-14-at-101121-image.png)Only ***47 open jobs*** for ui designers.Searching on LinkedIn gives the same sad low numbers.Is the ***harsh reality of tech in Africa*** hitting you now ?Is the ***extreme competition of tech*** hitting you now ?I didn't even talk about the ***10,000+ students graduating every year with a degree in Computer Scienc***e from Nigerian universities alone. Or the 100s of other schools bringing new people into tech.Or thousands more learning on their own.Reflections-----------Honestly, I didn't want to scare you with this newsletter, but I think sometimes it's good to see the reality of things so you can wake up.You can't be trying to get into tech in 2023 and have an empty Github profile or portfolio. I'm sorry, but it just won't cut it. You can't just be a coder. The competition is really high.It's going to take way more than just learning to code to build a successful career in tech.And that's why I spend ***many hours everyday*** working on my book ***Crushing Tech***, because someone needs to show you the secrets on how to stand out and compete.Lessons learned---------------Africa, and Nigeria in particular is not ready for all the talent we're producing. We're creating so much talent, but our government is to blame for not having the innovation and tech to put this talent to work.It's quite sad to be honest. So many amazing people like you, but so little companies that can put your skills and talent to work.So here's what to do.> Focus all your energy from day one on the European and North American (United States & Canada) tech market.> Your networking, open source, portfolio projects, should all take you one step closer to building a remote and global career in tech.That's the only way to survive, and that's my mission. To show you exactly how.And I'll keep showing you.Reply this email and tell me exactly how you feel about this newsletter.I'll reply back.Thank you again for reading.Until next week, stay growing.[Online version](https://frantz.mailcoach.app/webview/campaign/b3d739f2-6f63-4818-b761-96ccc9badc90) â€¢ [Unsubscribe](https://frantz.mailcoach.app/unsubscribe/fbba01de-5bd1-468f-a377-3337dae3438e/2a74a69f-0db8-467d-b2d1-748d151cc247) Sent by [Frantz Kati](https://twitter.com/bahdcoder?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=bad-news-harsh-truth-about-tech-no-one-is-talking-about)
